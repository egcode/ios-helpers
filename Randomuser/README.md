# Randomuser
=============

This project is iOS Assignment for Eugene Golovanov from TribalScale

## Supported Features:
1. The first screen will be a list of users obtained from an API

2. The second screen is viewed upon tapping on an item from the list on the first screen

## Bonus Feature:
 
Settings screen that allow users to set exact amount of users in the list


## If I would have more time, I would ad:

- Location snapshot in detail view. 
- Add option to settings to fetch specified sex.
- Large Images loading progress
- Reachability. Show alert if we donâ€™t have networks connected
- Accessebility
